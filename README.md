# Fintech Case Study: Ripple

## Author - Emilio Cubero

## Overview and Origin

Ripple is a leading fintech company that provides financial services to financial instituitions. The history of Ripple is extensive. Inspired by his work on a local exchange trading system, Ryan Fugger originally developed the concept of a decentralized monetary system that uses peer-to-peer trustlines to transact money(2). In 2011, Fugger launched RipplePay.com as the first iteration of his concept. Concurrently, a team of engineers by the names of David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto began developing what is now known as the XRP Ledger. "Fascinated by Bitcoin, they set out to create a better version that improved upon its limitations - with the goal of creating a digital asset that was more sustainable and built specifcally for payments." (3). The XRP Ledger was launched in June of 2012. Chris Larsen joined the creators of the XRPL shortly after its launch and helped acquire Fugger's RipplePay.com. Immediately after, the group founded a company named NewCoin in September of 2012, and then quickly renamed the company to OpenCoin. By 2013, OpenCoin had already completed an angel round of funding provided by an assortment of venture capital firms. Although the amount of funding was not disclosed, some of the firms include Andreessen Horowitz, FF Angel IV, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Vast Ventures, and Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. (4). OpenCoin changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc in 2013, and then changed its name again to Ripple in 2015. Ripple has also funded their endevours by selling the digital asset they created, XRP.

## Business Activities:

Although technology has evolved exponentially in many areas of life, the global financial sector has lagged behind in its technoligical innovation. Today's payment infastructure is a "patchwork of centralized networks, legacy technology, and different payment rails". These characteristics come with consequences. The current infastructure is "disparate, slow, error-prone, and costly". Ripple aims to solve these problems by offering their flagship software solution, RippleNet. RippleNet "is a global decentralized network that brings together the diverse ecosystem of payments players". It enables financial instituitions to connect to a network that makes global transactions "seamless, real-time, certain, and cost effective". The RippleNet network addresses all of the shortcomings of the existing legacy system, while simulatenously enabling more funcitonality. (5)

Ripple's ultimate mission is to unlock the power of blockchain to create an inclusive financial system that accelerates the internet of value. To achieve this, Ripple created a digital asset built for payments, XRP. XRP is "the native digital asset on the XRP Ledger — an open-source, permissionless and decentralized blockchain technology". The XRP Ledger uses a consesus algorithim to allow for transactions to settle in 3-5 seconds, to be cost efficient, and to be secure, which when then coupled with RippleNet, forms the "cornerstone of the internet of value". RippleNet customers can use XRP as a source of "On-Demand Liqudity" to facilate cross-border transactions with increased performacnce. XRP is a "universial asset for value exchange", which incetivizes Financial Instituitions to buy and hold XRP "to reduce, even eliminate, the need to pre-fund accounts". RippleNet in combination with XRP is the base layer of the Internet of Value. The value saved by the use of the Internet of Value, is realized by third-party participants, financial instustions, and Ripple.

Ripple primarily provides the RippleNet software solution to large financial institutions. As of 2021, over 300 financial instutions have joined RippleNet, including Bank of America, American Express, and Santander. There are tens of thousands of financial instituitions globally, but there are three types of financial institutions that can benefit the most from RippleNet: central banks, retail/commercial banks, and internet banks. Ripple has been targeting, and will continue to target, these specific financial instituitions. In March of 2021, Ripple piloted a a private ledger for central banks to launch Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC's) (9). Between RippleNet and XRP, Ripple has built a set of disruptive technolgies that brings the global banking sector into the modern age of money.  

Ripple's relative strength in the marketplace comes from several of its attributes: patents on certain aspects of the technology, relationships with leaders of central banks and other financial instituitions, and the strength and reliability of the network.

Ripple has filed and secured multiple patents since its inception. Many of these patents correspond directly to RippleNet and the use of XRP on RippleNet, such as this patent titled "Network computing system implementing on-demand liquidity for cross-medium transaction services" (10). 

Ripple has already created long lasting relationships with some of the largest finincial instituitions. The number of total financial instituitons using RippleNet has consistenlty increased, along with the total number of instituitions utilizing On-Demand Liquidity (XRP). 

RippleNet and the XRP Ledger are both reliable and tested networks. This trust in the technology is one of the primary factors that drives financial instituitions to want to participate in the ecosystem.

These attributes propel Ripple above their competitors. Some of these competitors include Stellar Lumens and Hedera Hashgraph, which both aim to be used as the base layer for CBDCs. Stellar uses a slightly different consensus alogrithim than XRP, while Hedara Hashgraph uses a hashgraph consensus algorithim. There are also instituional threats, such as JPM Coin, with similar solutions.

## Landscape:

Ripple operates within the realm of fintech, banking, and cryptocurrencies. The financial sector has had several new major trends withen the last decade, but some of the most revolutionary trends have become mainstream within the last couple of years. Some of new trends include the modernization of outdated core systems, the implementation of contactless payment,and the utilization of remote resources (11). Many companies such as Apple, Facebook (Meta), and Google have followed the trend and have catapulted the adoption of these new ideas. Ripple focuses on bringing the digital payments industry to the next level. They have created technologies that lay the foundation for a new quantum financial system, enable contacless payment on a global scale, and empower inernational remote resources.

Because Ripple has created such a disruptive set of technologies, they have been targeted by government agencies multiple times since its inception. In 2015, FinCEN, The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, fined Ripple for violating "several requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act by acting as a money services business and selling its virtual currency, known as XRP, without registering with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program designed to protect its products from use by money launderers or terrorist financiers." (12) Ironically, FinCEN's lawsuit was predicated on the sale of a virtual currency (XRP), but in 2020, the SEC sued Ripple for selling an unregistered security (XRP). The SEC alledges that "that Ripple, Larsen, and Garlinghouse failed to register their ongoing offer and sale of billions of XRP to retail investors, which deprived potential purchasers of adequate disclosures about XRP and Ripple's business and other important long-standing protections that are fundamental to our robust public market system." One of the biggest trends across the Fintech space is the lack of regulatory clarity. The Howey-test, the defacto test for determining what is a security, was created in 1933, and should not hold against these new technologies (14). As the SEC lawsuit continues to this day, governments and organizations around the world have been working diligently to define national and international crypto regulation, such as establishing global standards like ISO20022, "a single standardisation approach (methodology, process, repository) to be used by all financial standards initiatives"(15), whose parameters are met by only a handful of cryptocurrincies, such as XRP, XLM, XDC, and ALGO.

## Results

Ripple is generating a substantial amount of value for their customers. A large portion of the value that is lost through the expensive friction of the traditional financial system is realized by the use of RippleNet and XRP. Ripple has seen tremendous growth and currently stands as one of the largest unicorn fintech companies across the globe (1). They are continously expanding their client base while exploring new corridors of income. In fall of 2021, they announced Ripple Liquidity Hub, "a groundbreaking new way for enterprises to easily and efficiently source digital assets from the broader crypto market. As a crypto liquidity platform built for the enterprise, it will unleash the potential to access deep liquidity within markets, accelerating the shift to crypto" (16). Ripple is not only providing the infastructure of the new quantum finanical system, but they are also establshing a marketplace to trade the digital assets that run the new quantum financial system. Ripple's ongoing innovation and expansion into new ventures represents a quality metric that shows the health and future of this company.

XRP is a digital asset, and Ripple is private compnany. If Ripple ceased to exists, XRP and the XRPL would continue to function. Although XRP and Ripple are two completely different enitities, the price-action of XRP can be used to make assumptions about the depth of RippleNet. Specifcally, a sudden and drastic increase in price would indicate the mass adoption of XRP on an institutional level. Many players in the financial sector are sidelined waiting for regulatory clarity in order to operate with the use digital assets. XRP is one of the first major cryptos whose status as a cryptocurrency has been questioned in a court of law. Because XRP was one of the first ones in, it is likely that XRP will be one of the first ones out, which makes it likely for it to become one of the first cryptos with regulatory clarity. Once this clarity is established, finanical instituitions using RippleNet will come off the sidelines and invest heavily into XRP beause of the abundance of benefits that comes with its use.

Ripple is one of the top players in the crypto fintech space. They are in competition with other fintech companies, some of which have deployed digital assets as well. If XRP recieves regulatory clarity, it is most likely that other cryptos with similar properties will also recieve regulatory clarity. The fate of many of Ripple's competitors depends on the outcome if the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit.

## Recommendations

Covid-19 accelerated the devaluation of fiat currencies and the transistion to a digital world. The U.S. Dollar has lost 96% of its original value (17), and today, 82% of Americans are using digital payments(18). Fiat curriencies have become so devalued, that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is calling for a Bretton Woods Moment, in other words, a transition to a new world reserve currency(19). Ripple has created the infastructure and the digital asset that can facilitate the role of a supranational digital currency with world reserve currency status. Ripple should focus on offering solutions that onboard Central Banks and their Central Bank Digital Currencies. If they can achieve all of the world's central banks running on RippleNet and using XRP, Ripple has the potential to become the standard for government fintech services. Ripple has the core technology to achieve this, but they still may need to make some advnacements to their network, nontheless, Ripple has made it clear that they are a prime candidate to be the leaders of the new quantum financial system.

As much as XRP facilitates the use of RippleNet, Ripple should detach themselves from XRP as much as they can to show that it really is a decentralized open source distributed ledger technology that anybody can build on. As of lately, there have been many 3rd party innovations on the XRPL. Sologenic is decentralized exchange built on the XRPL that is used to trade assets over the XRPL with extremly low fees and an incredibly fast settlement time. On Sologenic, one can trade other assets built on the XRPL as well, such as CasinoCoin, XRDoge, and NFT IOU's. The XRPL will updated with NFT capabilities soon, which will open even more DeFi use cases. The point is that the XRPL is truly a public ecosystem, and Ripple is using what is availble to everyone else to ehance the performance of RippleNet. Ripple needs to make this apperently clear in their lawsuit with the SEC to show that XRP is a digital asset, and not a security. But they should not settle, without receivng regulatory clarity on the status of XRP.
